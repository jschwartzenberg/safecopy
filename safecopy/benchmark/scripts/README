This scripts can be used to generate benchmark data from a real "bad disk"
by running safecopy on it with the timing debug option like this:

safecopy --sync -L 2 -Z 0 -R 4 -f 1* -T timing.log -o badblocks.log -b <blocksize> <src> <dst>

auswertung.sh will parse timing.log and badblocks.log and create logfiles for
	good bad and recoverable sectors and their timings as well as nifty diagrams.
characteristics.sh will generate a template simulator.cfg to be used with the
	bad media simulator to simulate your disk
mean-calculation.sh can compare the result of auswertung.sh on your simulation
	and the real media to calculate how accurate the simulation went.

you will have to do your own measurements to find out seek times on your device
and set the
seekdelay=####
entry in simulator.cfg accordingly
seekdelay takes the average time to seek one sector distance in nanoseconds
(or rather the time it takes to seek over 1000 sectors in microseconds) on
hard disks this value is usually less than zero, so it doesn't need to be set.
